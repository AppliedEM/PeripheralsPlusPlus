# Satellites

---

Satellites are a new way expansion of a computer's abilities. Satellites can be crafted with one main upgrade and a variable amount of addon upgrades. The main upgrade dictates the satellite's functions. Addon upgrades enhance the abilities of satellites and/or their main upgrades. The addon upgrades each have a weight percentage. A satellite can only hold up to 100% of its capacity with addon upgrades. 

## Launching A Satellite
In order to send a satellite to space, you first need to build a rocket. Once you place a rocket into the world, you can right click it and place 3 things; the satellite, oxidizers and fuel. It is recommended to upgrade the satellite, otherwise it'll do nothing. Rockets require a large amount of oxidizers and fuel in order to be able to reach space. The oxidizer is gunpowder and the fuel is any burnable item. Oxidizers help the rocket gain speed, but increases fuel usage and fuel is what the rocket uses to move, the fuel values are the same as what they are worth in a furnace. The key is to find a "golden ratio" of sorts between oxidizer fuel, but you'll need to play around in order to find out ;).
