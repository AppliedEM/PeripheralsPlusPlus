## About Peripherals++
Peripherals++ is an addon for [ComputerCraft](http://computercraft.info/) by austinv11. It is was created to fill the vacuum left behind by RichardG when he abandoned his mod, [MiscPeripherals](http://www.computercraft.info/forums2/index.php?/topic/4587-cc153mc152-miscperipherals-33/). This mod aims to be a pseudo-port of MiscPeripherals, as well as adding original mechanics too!

In order to install this mod, you must have [MinecraftForge](http://files.minecraftforge.net/) installed on an instance of Minecraft in addition to [ComputerCraft](http://computercraft.info/). You could then download the latest release on the [forum post](http://www.computercraft.info/forums2/index.php?/topic/20903-) or the bleeding edge (sometimes unstable) version on [drone.io](https://drone.io/github.com/austinv11/PeripheralsPlusPlus/files) and then install the mod on your Minecraft instance.
