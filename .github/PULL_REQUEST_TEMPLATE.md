### 1. Coding Conventions

If you wish to have your pull request approved, you **must** follow my conventions.

#### Tabs or spaces?

Tabs, it must be tabs. No, I don't care why you think spaces are better.

#### Brackets

Please use [1tbs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style#Variant:_1TBS) with the exception that one line conditional
statements do not need brackets. Yes, I know, your style is better, blah blah blah.
