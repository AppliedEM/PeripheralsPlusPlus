The permissions card is used with the [player interface](https://github.com/austinv11/PeripheralsPlusPlus/wiki/Player-Interface) and tells the interface what it is allowed to do to different player's inventories. Before editing the card, it has to be linked to a player right clicking with it. After it is linked, the permissions can be edited by sneaking and right clicking. After editing the permissions, the card can be placed in the interface.
