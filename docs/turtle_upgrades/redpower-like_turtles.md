# Redpower-like Turtles

---

When [Project Red: Exploration](http://projectredwiki.com/wiki/Main_Page) and/or [Bluepower](http://minecraft.curseforge.com/mc-mods/223099-blue-power) is installed, it's tools can be crafted with a Turtle to make the equivalent turtle. These act like the appropriate diamond tool Turtles, except with the traits of the item used to craft them.
