# Dynamic Mount

---

Peripherals++ will automagically mount various sample and full-featured programs which either demonstrate the features of certain peripherals or just do something neat ;). The programs mounted are dependent upon the peripheral(s) attached to a given computer under the "ppp" directory. These programs are automatically updated when Minecraft is launched, so you never need to update the mod to get up-to-date programs. It is stored in the "ppp_mount" directory in your mods folder.

## Submitting Programs
This is open-sourced for a reason, community participation is much appreciated! If you want to show off a cool program which utilizes features added by my mod just follow the requirements below and you might be able to see your program included with the mod! Just note that I may modify your program if the need arises.

**The Program**
* The program can _only_ use features included with vanilla Computercraft and with Peripherals++
* The program should have some comments (not a requirement but it would be awesome)
* The program should not utilize the http api or any other features which are not enabled by default

**Submissions**
* There are two ways to submit; posting on the [forum post](http://www.computercraft.info/forums2/index.php?/topic/20903-) or submitting an issue with your program (with a [Program] tag in the title)
* While I know mistakes can happen _please_ debug your programs

**Maintenance**
* If for some reason you want your program updated, please either PM me on the Computercraft forums or submit an issue (with a [Program Update] tag in the title)
* If you are updating your program, I'd prefer it if you use the version on this repo (located somewhere [here](https://github.com/austinv11/PeripheralsPlusPlus/tree/master/lua)) as I may have made some modifications to it for whatever reason
